# Case 1: Study Focus Drone – Posture Corrector
Scenario Description:
When people study or work for a long time, they often sit badly without knowing it. This can cause neck and back pain, and make it hard to focus. This drone will quietly watch your posture and help you sit in a better way, so you can study more easily.

Interaction Method:
The drone uses a camera to watch your head and body. If it sees you are sitting badly, like bending forward or lowering your head, the drone will fly closer and flash a soft yellow light to remind you to sit up straight.

Required Technologies:

OpenCV to track head and shoulder position

DNN to tell if posture is good or bad

Drone flying control and LED light control SDK





# Case 2: Emotional Comfort Drone – Music Mood Matching
Scenario Description:
Music can change how people feel. This drone listens to the music around you and changes how it flies and what color it shows, making the room feel more lively or calm depending on the song.

Interaction Method:
The drone uses a microphone to hear the music. It uses AI to guess the mood of the music (happy, sad, energetic). Then, it changes its flying style and LED light color to match the feeling of the song. (For example, bright pink for happy, blue for calm.)

Required Technologies:

Microphone to hear music and real-time sound analysis

DNN to guess music emotion

Drone flying and LED color control SDK





# Case 3: Interactive Fitness Drone – Workout Companion
Scenario Description:
When people exercise at home, they sometimes lose motivation because no one is there to cheer them up. This drone becomes a workout buddy. It watches your movements (like doing squats or push-ups) and cheers for you after you finish a set.

Interaction Method:
The drone uses a camera to follow your body moves and count how many times you move. When you finish one set, it flashes green lights and does a happy flying dance to celebrate and make you feel good.

Required Technologies:

OpenCV to track body movement and features

DNN to recognize exercise moves and count repetitions

Drone happy flying control and LED color control SDK
